## Information
This is an Arabic translation patch for Touhou 5 Mystic Square.

Patch files are in the [releases](https://github.com/Aweseome245/Touhou-5-Mystic-Square-AR/releases/tag/v1.01) page, and installation instructions are in the اقرأني (readme) file.

Due to the custom font.bmp file, this patch will not work on real hardware.

## Patch details
I've left information on the files, text and pictures in [Notes.txt](https://github.com/Aweseome245/Touhou-5-Mystic-Square-AR/blob/master/Notes.txt) (and some other txt files) for anyone who wants to make a patch to another language or is just interested to see how it works.

[Mystic Toolkit](https://lunarcast.net/mystictk.php) was used to decompile and recompile the files, and program code was taken from [the ReC98 repository](https://github.com/nmlgc/ReC98/tree/xJeePx) and compiled with Tasm, which is provided in this repository.

I used the Unixel font to make the Arabic font file.
